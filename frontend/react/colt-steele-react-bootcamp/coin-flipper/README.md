This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Another coding challenge. App should feature a button that flips a coin when clicked. 
Visuals: Coin image, count of heads tails and total flips.

Design features: 
    1) minimal centralized state with downward data flow.
